        <h3><i>Intersection of Cognition and AI</i></h3>
        <img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2666920X22000625-gr1.jpg" alt="Cognition" width=300 id="cogai">
        <p id="a">Cognition refers to the mental processes involved in acquiring, understanding, and using information, including perception, memory, reasoning, and decision-making. Artificial Intelligence (AI) seeks to replicate or augment these processes using computational models, machine learning, and neural networks. The intersection of cognition and AI represents an evolving field that combines insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computer science to develop intelligent systems capable of human-like reasoning and adaptability. AI systems increasingly draw inspiration from human cognition to improve their learning and decision-making capabilities. Cognitive architectures such as ACT-R and SOAR attempt to model human thought processes, while deep learning networks mimic neural activity. The goal is to create AI that can process information more efficiently, generalize across tasks, and adapt to new environments without extensive retraining.</p>
            <h4>Areas of Overlap</h4>
                <ul id="cogint">
                    <li>Learning and Adaptation: AI leverages machine learning to improve over time, similar to how humans learn from experience and feedback.</li>
                    <li>Pattern Recognition: Just as human cognition identifies patterns in sensory input, AI uses algorithms to detect structures in data, such as recognizing faces or translating languages.</li>
                    <li>Decision-Making: AI incorporates probabilistic models to simulate decision-making, mirroring how humans weigh options based on context and prior knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Problem-Solving and Creativity: While AI can generate novel solutions through optimization and generative models, it still lacks the intuitive and abstract thinking capabilities of the human mind.</li>
                </ul>
