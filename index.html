            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p id="a">Hi! My name is Nasir Stanley, and I am a second-year student at Northeastern University, where I am pursuing a dual degree in Behavioral Neuroscience and Data Science. I have a deep passion for understanding the complexities of the human brain and how data-driven solutions can revolutionize the field of neuroscience and healthcare. My academic journey has allowed me to explore the intersection of these two disciplines, equipping me with the skills to analyze complex biological systems through computational methods.
                I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics can be leveraged to advance neuroscience research, improve diagnostics, and develop more effective treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Through my coursework and research experiences, I have gained a strong foundation in programming, statistical modeling, and neuroscience, which I hope to apply toward innovative solutions in healthcare.
                Beyond academics, I am involved in organizations such as Neurons and ColorStack NEU, where I engage with like-minded peers and contribute to initiatives that support diversity in STEM. My goal is to work at the forefront of neuroscience and technology, bridging the gap between data science and medicine to enhance patient outcomes and drive meaningful advancements in the field.</p>
